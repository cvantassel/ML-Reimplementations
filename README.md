# ML-Reimplementations

Since completing my master's degree and taking up a job in industry, I've found that I quite miss learning and deepening my understanding of mathematics.
With extensive online courses and resources at my disposal, I've decided to leverage these to continue my education.

To start, I've taken a couple courses on Machine Learning, namely: 
- Imperial College London's [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Multivariate Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/multivariate-calculus-machine-learning)
- Stanford's [CS229: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)

Now having completed these, I want to exercise my understanding of what I've learned about the theory behind Machine Learning algorithms. To do this, I've decided to create bare-bones implementations of the cornerstone algorithms of the field. 

In this repository, I intend to put my understanding to the test, and fill in any knowledge gaps I have along the way. I will be making an effort to highlight the portions of the algorithms I found unclear, and provide visualizations to clear up these confusions when possible.

Below is a list of algorithms I intend to cover:
- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- [ ] Neural Networks
